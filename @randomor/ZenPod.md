# Why ZenPod?

Imagine if listening to podcasts could be as simple as turning on the radio. What if you had a grid of channels, and with a single tap, you could tune into the latest episodes? And your favorite stations would always be at the top of the grid, ready for easy access.

As a long-time podcast enthusiast, I've found myself juggling dozens of active podcasts. Like many listeners, I have a handful of favorites that I want to hear as soon as they're released. But prioritizing these shows often involves creating complex playlists and navigating through numerous menus. In apps like Overcast, setting up a useful playlist can be a tedious process - creating a custom list, selecting podcasts from your extensive library, then prioritizing certain shows within that selection. It's a lot of taps and swipes just to streamline your listening experience.

This frustration is what inspired ZenPod. I'm obsessed with simplifying this process, making it easier for podcast lovers to enjoy their favorite content without the hassle.

ZenPod is currently a work in progress. If you're interested in trying it out, reach out for TestFlight access.
