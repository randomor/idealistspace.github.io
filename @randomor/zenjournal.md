# ZenJournal

https://thezenjournal.com

Being an avid journal writer when I was in college, I have the urge of getting back to journaling again, but none of the dozen journaling apps I've tried feel right, so I had to create this app.

This breaks a few mold in typical journaling apps, yet every decision feels natural and logical:

### No need to unlock to start typing. 

Unlock with FaceID only when needed. Nothing should stop you from writing. Before you unlock the app, your timeline will just be hidden, all your past logs will be turning into "░░░" so no one can view your logs without unlocking, but 99.9% of the time it will just allow you to get to your thoughts faster, as there is no friction.

### No new entry button. 

Open the app, the keyboard is already focused on the text entry, you can start typing right away.

### No tap to view a specific entry.

### No dedicated search field
